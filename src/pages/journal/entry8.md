   Consuming the right type of food is also crucial to elevate your energy level. Steer clear of refined carbohydrates, sugar, as well as foods with low fiber and high saturated fat.

These complex carbohydrates will be digested in an extensive period of time, keeping you full for longer and releasing energy for your body in a steady supply.
4. Rehydrate frequently
