Viral infections such as cold or flu are especially important to be vigilant about these days, as a new strain of virus called coronavirus is known to cause a pandemic worldwide. However, it is by no means a call for panic, as you can practice some steps to take effective prevention method. Simple steps like frequently washing your hands to staying hydrated, can go a long way in providing you with viral infection protection. Furthermore, on this week's journal, we will be explaining other healthy habits to protect yourselves from getting the flu. Read on!

1. Avoid sharing
	While it's not always possible to avoid every sick people, you might want to try to reduce contact with people that you know are having the flu. Even more important, you should pay extra attention in order to not let your defenses down against viruses. This can be done by not sharing your cutleries, straws, or drinks, as things that come in contact on, in, or near a person's mouth can transfer germs.

2. Clean your hands
	Your hand is an important medium when it comes to spreading of viral diseases. A lot of things are being performed with our hands, from counting money, shaking hands with other people, to eating. Therefore, their cleanliness are of high priority when trying to maintain your well-being. Practice good hand washing through lathering soap all over your hands and rubbing them together thoroughly before rinsing under running water. When hand washing is not possible, you can also carry hand sanitizers to reduce germs and lower your risk of getting flu virus. Another thing you can also do is to avoid constantly touching your eyes and nose, as they can be common entry points of bacteria and viruses into the body.

3. Consume nutritious foods
	A healthy diet is a standard drill when it comes to taking care of your well-being. This is because a healthy, balanced diet can help build a strong immune system within your body, thus protecting your from viral diseases. Studies have shown that 70 percent of our immunity depends on gut balance, making it an important focal point to maintain our health. Therefore, consuming probiotics and fermented foods can help strengthen immunity and a great way to rebalance the microbiome inside your gut. Avoid consuming too much of processed food, as they mainly contain refined sugar, salt and oil. Make sure to consume fruits and vegetables daily, as well as protein and complex carbohydrates that are essential to support your routine throughout the day and maintain gut health.

4. Obtain enough sleep
	Sleeping well is crucial to restore your cells and maintain immunity, as lack of sleep is associated with lower immune function, which can leave you more susceptible to viruses. Lack of sleep can also elevate stress hormones, like cortisol. When your body is under stress, immunity is almost automatically lowered and may lead you to various illnesses, including viral ones. Therefore, sleeping for 7 to 9 hours per night is recommended, as it is beneficial to support other body functions, such as maintaining cognitive health, cardiovascular health, as well as maintaining healthy weight.

5. Exercise regularly
	It is commonly known that exercise may help improve cardiovascular health and controls healthy weight. Constant movement, predominantly through exercise, can help to improve the circulation of the bodyâ€™s lymphatic flow and eventually helps toxins to be cleared out of the body. All of this promotes a healthier lifestyle, as by exercising frequently, you can also strengthen the immune system. Exercise may increase the white blood cells involved inside the body, making your immune response more effective in preventing illnesses. Moreover, if you exercise outdoor, vitamin D you get from the sun can also boost your immunity and prevent you from catching cold and flu easily.
