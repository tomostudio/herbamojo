Spending a lot of time at home may either bore you or make you a lot more productive by planning a number of things to do, including doing workouts. Aside from keeping you in shape, working out regularly can also aid your immunity so you can keep yourself fit inside out. There might be a number of things you may want to consider before doing home workouts, so you can overcome the challenges. Therefore, on this week's journal, we will be giving out a few tips for you to do effective workouts at home. Read on!

1. Allocate a dedicated space for your workout
	Free up a corner on your room or any space in your house and dedicate it as a mini gym. Whether you're planning to do yoga or lifting weights, organizing your workout equipments in one place will definitely help you focus more on the exercises rather than the hassle of locating your stuff. Aside from that, working out on a designated space also helps you avoid knocking things around the house. Make sure to have enough space to open your arms and to stretch your legs.

2. Search for workout videos online
	With various online video sharing services available at the tap of your fingers, it's easy to find workout videos that suit your needs. This way, you won't be bored by just doing one type of workout every single time, as well as ensuring that every part of your body is well-trained during your time at home. You can also calibrate the workout routine to your level, from beginner to advanced.

3. Use equipments when necessary
	Sometimes your workout routine needs equipment that can support you well. If you own a treadmill or static bike, those can be utilized for your workout at home. However, don't necessarily go out your way to purchase it if you don't have it, as there are still an array of workout routines that you can do at home. Only buy sporting goods that you need and subsitute the rest with the equipments that you already own. You can also design your workout to be equipment-free, given that you follow the right routine. Most of the time, the essentials that you need to have at home are a gym ball and a set of dumbbells for strength training. You can also invest in resistance bands and jump rope. 

4. Keep your focus during workouts
	When you are not used to doing things at home, distractions can be a major problem. TV, phone calls and notifications, pets, as well as family members can all distract you from focusing on your workout. Therefore, try your best to minimize these distractions. You can ask your family member to attend to household matters during your workout session instead of cutting it short. Aside from that, don't forget to turn off your phone or muting notifications while you are exercising to ensure focus.

5. Don't overwhelm yourself
	While your routine at home during this pandemic might take a hit on your body weight, don't force yourself to get in shape by doing numerous workouts. Not only that this can tire you out and hinder yourself from doing routine exercises, but this habit can also demotivate you in the long run. Starting small is the best thing you can do as you and your body adjust to this new routine. Get your exercise done in 15-45 minutes everyday, then focus on your weekly goals. Just aim to keep yourself physically active even though you're mostly staying in. You can then gradually add more time to your daily workout and set a tangible goal for the end of every week. Establishing this kind of routine can help you in the long run and motivates you more once the result kicks in.
