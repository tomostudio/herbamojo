# 5 Ways Alcohol Consumption May Affect Male Health

Known to be social drinks, beer and other beverages that contain alcohol are a common sight during events or get-togethers at bars and other venues. While it might be fine to consume these substances in a reasonable portion, it is also important to know how they affect your body and well-being. On this week's journal, we will be explaining a few factors that alcohol may do to your body. Read on!

# How does alcohol affect men?

The average men weighs more than the average women, therefore has more tissue in the body to absorb alcohol. Men also have a proportionally lower ratio of fat to water than women. This shows that men are more able to dilute alcohol within the body and would end up with a lower concentration of alcohol in their blood. However, men tend to experience more alcohol-related harm and injury than women because on average they drink more.

## 1. Affects your sexual performance

When consumed in small amounts, alcohol may give you confidence and help you feel less inhibited. However, alcohol depresses the central nervous system and disrupts with the signals between the brain and the genitals, interfering your ability to feel sexual stimulation. Such disruptions can make men find it difficult to ejaculate or even may ejaculate too quickly. Study shows that men who drink too much are more likely to experience erectile dysfunction. Heavy drinking can also reduce sex hormone production and lower your libido.

## 2. Lowers testosterone levels

Research has shown that constant consumption of alcohol may affect testosterone levels, which can lead to loss of libido. Aside from affecting hormone levels, alcohol may inhibit the function of the testes and stop sperm from developing properly. This can result in reduction of sperm quantity and quality, as well as ability to move towards an egg. Alcohol may also affect the structure and movement of sperm by stopping the liver from properly metabolising vitamin A11, which is needed for sperm to develop. While high-risk drinking may be a possible cause of infertility, there is some evidence that even small amounts of alcohol can also affect fertility.

## 3. Messes your appearance

Most people will probably be watchful over what they eat, especially when consuming junk foods. However, the same should also be done when consuming alcohol. In fact, a junk food meal may equate to drinking 4 pints of your favorite beer. You can easily lost track over the latter, as it is liquid calorie and you don't really get full over drinking. This habit, when continued, can easily drive you into weight gain. Aside from the calories, alcohol may also reduce the amount of fat your body burns for energy. Since the body can't store alcohol, the process of digesting alcohol takes priority over absorbing nutrients and burning fat, making your metabolism slow down and may give you the signature beer belly.

## 4. Causes long-term health issues

Consuming alcohol on a regular basis can also cause a more serious consequences than just unruly physical appearance. For example, it can cause gout, an arthritic condition that causes inflammation, swelling and pain in your joints, commonly found in men aged 30 to 60. Moreover, excess drinking can also harm your health, as it can damage the liver permanently and cause heart disease, trigger cancer, irritate the bowel, cause diabetes, as well as trigger anxiety and depression.

## 5. Dependency & causes brain damage

Finally, regular drinking leads to the body building up a tolerance to alcohol. While consuming a glass of alcohol per day may do little damage to your overall health, when you get sucked into the habit of not stopping after one glass, the cumulative health effects may add up. For example, heavy drinkers may develop a physical and emotional dependency on alcohol. For these individuals, alcohol withdrawal can be difficult and life-threatening. Alcohol addiction is something to take seriously and often need professional rehabilitation.

Drinking habit also affects your central nervous system's activity. That's why, when people get drunk, they often speak in a slurred manner and do uncoordinated movements. It will also be difficult for your brain to create long-term memories, reducing your ability to think clearly and make rational choices. Over time, chronic alcohol abuse may cause permanent brain damage, especially the frontal lobe. This area of the brain is responsible for emotional control, short-term memory, and judgement, in addition to other vital roles.
