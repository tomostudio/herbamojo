## Do things you actually enjoy doing

Often times, laziness stems from not enjoying the work you are doing. When you are excited about something, you will be pumped and always look forward to it. The same thing applies to exercise; maybe your idea of exercise is boring or too much of a hardwork. However, starting from the small things still counts when you want to make a change. At least you're putting effort into things, and may even enjoy the process. 
Pick a physical activity that you enjoy doing, and view it not as a task that you need to do, but instead as a hobby. Once you feel satisfied, it is much easier to get excited with it and you may naturally feel challenged to tackle harder tasks.

## Set realistic targets

Once you have an activity in place, you may want to do it leisurely or set a target. However, be reminded that you shouldn't put too much pressure on yourself that may hinder your progress in the long run. Setting unrealistic targets or too high standards can be a recipe of failure, therefore just try to build from one achievement to another. These smaller victories can then motivate you to do more things that can help you achieve your bigger goal.

## Track your progress

Keeping track of your exercise routine is important to keep yourself accustomed to the commitment you have made, as well as making it easier to see the differences you've made along the way. When you know you have made a certain milestone, it may also help you feel more motivated. Some of the ways you can track your progress is by weighing yourself on the scale, measuring your body with a tape, get a body fat test, or simply by just feeling the way your clothes fit on your body.

## Keep yourself accountable

When things seem to not progress or not heading towards your goal, it's very easy to get demotivated or sidetracked. You may start to give up at this point, therefore it is equally important to have a good social support to keep yourself accountable. Having friends to exercise with can also help you feel more motivated to exercise regularly. You may even have a mini-competition going between your group, in order to keep your fire going.

## Reward yourself

Finally, achieving your goal is the byproduct of your determination and hard work. All those times you put to work has actually give you something in return, and it's great to reward yourself with the things you enjoy. It might be treating yourself to a new pair of shoes, eating the foods you like, or engrossing yourself in movies. Offer yourself a reward when you achieve something, and it may help to be more motivated in doing your exercise.
