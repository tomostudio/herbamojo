	As we're living in a increasingly fast-paced world, high levels of stress is very common.

This, in return, promotes the production of sex hormones and improve libido. Ginseng's ability to lower stress levels also helps to manage fluctuations in sex drive. 
	A number of studies have also shown ginseng as an effective treatment for reducing symptoms of erectile dysfunction, as well as improving male fertility. Male who takes ginseng supplements regularly tend to have higher sperm counts and increased sperm motility, so it is surely recommended as a complementary treatment option for men with infertility caused by low sperm count.

Therefore, ginseng’s potential to improve memory can also be utilized for Alzheimer’s and dementia treatment for elderly people.
