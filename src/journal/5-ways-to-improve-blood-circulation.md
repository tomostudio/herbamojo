As one of the most important functions in the body, blood circulation is highly crucial to transport oxygen to the entire body organs. Not having enough oxygen in your body may cause fatigue, to even other chronic illnesses. Therefore, it is recommended to implement healthy habits so your blood circulation can run smoothly, especially during this pandemic where our physical movement is limited. On this week's journal, we will be discussing a number of ways to help your blood circulating optimally as it should be. Read on!

1. Stretch and exercise daily

Every morning or whenever time is convenient for you, set aside some time to do physical movements. Starting off with a stretch, it can help improve circulation by lengthening your muscles so they are not prone to injury and stiffness before you start an exercise regime. This is the least you can do, especially if you work office job and tend to live a sedentary lifestyle. Sitting for too long may cause stiffness in your neck, shoulders, and back, as well as not really good for your posture.
Then, incorporating regular exercise for at least 30 minutes a day can also be beneficial for increasing blood flow, boosting metabolism, as well as giving you a burst of energy you need to face your daily errands. Any exercise, be it aerobic or strength training, can help your blood circulate better by dilating the blood vessels and allow muscles to receive oxygen more easily.

2. Ensure enough nutrition intake

Certain type of foods can help promote blood flow. For example, foods high in vitamin C and E, as well as foods rich in antioxidant. Two of the most prominent blood thinning foods include ginger, garlic, and onion. Eating foods rich in iron, like red meat or spinach, may also help aid circulation. 
Some people may opt to consume supplements. We recommend natural supplements like Herbamojo, which is also able aid your blood circulation. Its red ginger content may help improve blood circulation, as well as boosting energy. Made from 100% natural plant extract, this supplement is suitable to be consumed everyday to support better health.

3. Consume omega-3 rich foods

Omega-3 fatty acids are able to improve blood circulation, one study shows. You can consume omega-3 through a variant of fishes, like salmon, tuna, or mackerel. Vegetables like kale also contains a small amount of omega-3. For those who aren't eating fish, omega-3 supplement can be the last resort.

4. Maintain healthy weight

If you're wondering how healthy weight direcly supports blood circulation, the answer would be the narrowing of arteries caused by fat. This excess fat can clog arteries and restrict blood flow, increasing the chances of cardiovascular problems like stroke and heart attack.
A study has also found that losing weight may improve blood circulation, as increased levels of protein called adiponectin, associated with vascular function. Therefore, always make sure to watch your weight, not only for looks sake, but more importantly, your health and well-being.

5. Quit smoking and reduce alcohol intake

For most people, smoking and drinking alcohol is a habit they may do occassionally for fun. However, these lifestyle habits may cost you your health in the long run. Similar to overweight people, smokers tend to have narrow arteries. Nicotine causes the release of fat and cholesterol into the bloodstream, then clog the walls of your arteries and lead to hardening. This, of course, is the culprit of poor blood circulation.
While moderate and occassional drinking is still acceptable, drinking alcohol long-term also does more bad than good when it comes to improving blood circulation. Alcohol has been shown to cause irregular heartbeat, as well as weakness in the heart, thus not able to pump blood throughout the body.
