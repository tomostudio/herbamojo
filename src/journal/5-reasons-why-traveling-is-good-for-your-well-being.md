As end of year is coming near, a lot of us are taking time to spend time with families and close relatives at home, or even traveling to new destinations. More than just taking pictures of breathtaking places or trying exotic foods, traveling is actually beneficial for your health and well-being in the long run. On this week's journal, we will explain a number of benefits traveling may give you, aside from being a temporary escape from your routine. Read on!

## 1. Sharpens your thinking

As traveling requires you to get familiar with new language, schedule, vicinities, transport methods, and all that is needed to get from one point to the other, it forces you to break the pattern of your usual routine at home and make quick yet calculated decisions. While you might run into challenging situations where you need to be resourceful and think differently, you may also learn new things about yourself that you might not know you had it in you! This exercise can surely help you stay sharp and you may even bring the skill home to implement in your daily organization routine.

## 2. Reduces your stress

The reason why people are adviced to take a break from their routine once in a while is to reduce the stress they had piling up, whether it may be because of work, personal relationships, and other problems. Traveling is usually one of those escapes that are in the forefront of everyone's mind. When you are not used to breaking the pattern or staying in your comfort zone most of your lifetime, traveling can definitely have a tremendous impact on your mental well-being.

## 3. Keeps you fit

When you travel, you are forced to be active in some ways. For example, if you are not used to walk in your hometown, go to a place where you can walk to enjoy more of the scenery. This way, you can get to see more of the place, as well as jacking up your active lifestyle. Also, a study has shown that people who frequently takes time off for vacation are generally less stressed and anxious, therefore they are less likely to suffer a heart attack or develop heart disease in the long run.

## 4. Broadens your perspective

During your travels, you will almost always find new things to do, new people to meet, and new experiences to discover. Even if you travel to the same place twice, there's no way it will be the same as your first one. This helps you to expand your horizon and gain different perspective in life. As you become more culturally aware, new experiences increase your cognitive flexibility and keep your mind sharp. Studies have shown a connection between travel and an increase in creativity, a deeper sense of cultural awareness and personal growth.

Compared to seeing informations on TV or by reading books, experiencing things first-hand abroad can help you to be open to a more unique and unbiased perspective. This, in turn, will help you develop as a more open and emotionally stable individual, which can benefit you a whole lot in life. Moreover, being exposed to new cultures and people will greatly shift your paradigm and create a healthier perspective once you return back home. Seeing differences during your travels can help create compassion and makes you feel more blessed and content in life.

## 5. Refreshes your mind

Stepping away from routine and taking your time to go on a journey can be a great way to reduce stress and give your life a little excitement boost. When done right, it can even greatly benefit you once you return home with renewed energy and a refreshed mind to face whatever challenges you may face in your work or daily life. Invest your time in traveling while you can, as it can greatly enhance your productivity and help shift your attitude into a more valuable individual.
