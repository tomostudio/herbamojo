These benefits for the immunity should be credited to powerful antioxidants called ginsenosides, which have been shown to decrease levels of harmful hormones, reduce inflammation and support cognitive functioning. Many studies have shown that ginseng is an excellent anti-stress agent by reducing production of stress hormones like cortisol. Studies in 2017 and 2020, although inconclusive, showed that ginseng may offer protection against viral respiratory tract infections, including seasonal flu, influenza, as well as common cold.
