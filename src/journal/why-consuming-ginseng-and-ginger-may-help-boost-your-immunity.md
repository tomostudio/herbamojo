Benefits of ginger for respiratory health and immunity
	Ginger price on the market has recently been on the rise due to COVID-19, and this is not without any good reasoning. Having a myriad of benefits for health, ginger's warming effect has long been deemed useful to treat and prevent both common cold and flu. Ginger is also useful in managing common respiratory illness, as well as cough and throat problems. Ginger works by expanding your lungs and loosening up mucus/phlegm in your airway, acting as a natural expectorant that breaks down and removes mucus. Therefore, consuming ginger frequently may help you quickly recover from difficulty in breathing.
	Consuming ginger is also useful to safeguard you against bacterial and viral infections. Ginger acts by decreasing bacterial infections in the stomach, as well as improving absorption of essential nutrients in the body by stimulating gastric and pancreatic enzyme secretion. High immunity starts in the gut, so ginger may help you build your immunity and aid your body's defense mechanism against bacteria and viruses naturally.
	With benefits for the respiratory system and immunity, studies have also shown that ginger may help prevent you from getting sick due to a respiratory virus, preventing the virus from attaching to and infecting upper respiratory tract cells. Ginger consumption stimulates the respiratory cells to secrete an anti-viral protein, as well as inhibiting mucus production and clearing up nasal congestion.
